            <p>
                Taj Mahal, also spelled Tadj Mahall, mausoleum complex in Agra, western Uttar Pradesh state, northern
                India. The Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628–58) to immortalize his
                wife Mumtaz Mahal (“Chosen One of the Palace”), who died in childbirth in 1631, having been the
                emperor’s inseparable companion since their marriage in 1612. India’s most famous and widely recognized
                building, it is situated in the eastern part of the city on the southern (right) bank of the Yamuna
                (Jumna) River. Agra Fort (Red Fort), also on the right bank of the Yamuna, is about 1 mile (1.6 km) west
                of the Taj Mahal.

                The Mysore Palace, also known as Amba Vilas Palace, is a historical palace and a royal residence
                (house). It is located in Mysore, Karnataka. It used to be the official residence of the Wadiyar
                dynasty
                and the seat of the Kingdom of Mysore. The palace is in the centre of Mysore, and faces the Chamundi
                Hills eastward. Mysore is commonly described as the 'City of Palaces', and there are seven palaces
                including this one. However, the Mysore Palace refers specifically to the one within the Old Fort.
