    <p><b> Meet the boss of Indian historical places. If you consider the top 10 historical places in India, Taj Mahal
            will always be ranking high in the list. Explore the ultimate epitome of love, the Taj Mahal, whose grandeur
            remains unmatched in history and today this is one of the weekend getaways from Delhi. This opulent white
            marble structure was commissioned to be built in 1632 by Shah Jahan for his late wife Mumtaz Mahal. It took
            around 22 years to complete this magnificent structure that is considered one of the most famous historical
            places in India.

            According to local legend, it was believed that Shah Jahan cut off the hands of all the workers who built
            the Taj Mahal so that a similar monument could not be built.</b></p>

    <p><b><i><u>Interesting fact</u></i>: A shopping complex and hotel inspired by the Taj Mahal is being constructed in
            Dubai and is estimated to be four times larger in size.<br><a
