    <p><b>The Ajanta Caves constitute ancient monasteries and worship-halls of different Buddhist traditions carved into
            a 75-metre (246 ft) wall of rock.The caves also present paintings depicting the past livesand rebirths of
            the Buddha, pictorial tales from Aryasura's Jatakamala, and rock-cut sculptures of Buddhist deities.Textual
            records suggest that these caves served as a monsoon retreat for monks, as well as a resting site for
            merchants and pilgrims in ancient India.While vivid colours and mural wall-painting were abundant in Indian
            history as evidenced by historical records, Caves 16, 17, 1 and 2 of Ajanta form the largest corpus of
            surviving ancient Indian wall-painting.</b>

    <p><b><i><u>Interesting fact</u></i>:It is believed that the Buddhist monks were not allowed to go out during the
            monsoons and would sit and carve sculptures in the Ajanta caves.<br><a
